ML Assignment 3 from the subject JM0150-M-6: Data Mining

The last two models involving VGG16 were too heavy to be uploaded on git.
Thus, they were uploaded on Google drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qxsAEzhJURXDhmo8fkDpYODDkd-cIGM6?usp=sharing

There is another folder available there ("other models") with the other models tested for question 4 that were also too heavy to be uploaded on git.

Furthermore, a folder of the outputs of the Keras_tuner is also there ("assignment3")
